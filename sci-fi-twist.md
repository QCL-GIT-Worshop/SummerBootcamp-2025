# Three Sci-Fi Twists 2

## 1. The Time Travel Blackout Paradox
Premise: Time travel exists, but every time someone travels to the past, they lose all their memories until they return to their original timeline.
Twist: A time agent discovers a past version of themselves leading a rebellion—but the agent has no memory of ever joining it. They must decide: sabotage their past self to preserve the timeline or trust a version of themselves they can’t remember.

## 2. The Conscious Planet Swap
Premise: Humanity colonizes what appears to be an uninhabited planet with rich resources.
Twist: The entire planet is actually a sentient being, and every 100 years, it swaps places with another sentient planet in the galaxy. Colonists wake up one day under a different sky—and a different planetary “mind” with its own rules, emotions, and judgments of human behavior.

## 3. The Upload Lottery
Premise: In the future, people can upload their minds to a virtual paradise after death, but only a limited number of “slots” open each year.
Twist: A dying protagonist wins the upload lottery—only to discover that everyone already inside is a fragmented version of themselves from alternate timelines. Each version is competing for control over the paradise, and only one version will survive the next system reboot.
